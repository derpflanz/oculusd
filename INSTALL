I got fed up with autotools (which are not so 'auto' after all) and created my own Makefiles.
This is not portable, but usable for us. If it works for you, you're lucky, if not, good luck.

Installation
============
Just 'make' and 'make install' as root.

It will install in 	/usr/

config files are in /etc/oculusd/
plugins are in 		/usr/lib/oculusd/
libs are in 		/usr/lib/
binaries are in		/usr/bin/
manpages are in		/usr/man/

Uninstallation
==============
Run 'make uninstall'. It should delete all files.
